/*************************************************************************
    The Date class is one that I wrote many years ago, and have used in 
    a variety of projects. It has built-in exceptions that are thrown 
    when a user enters an invalid date.
    The point of this little demo program is to teach you how to work 
    with these exceptions, a feature you are free to include in your 
    Checkbook::input function.
